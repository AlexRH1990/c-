    <p>The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated junglefowl species,
        with attributes of wild species such as the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl[1] 
        that are originally from Southeast Asia. Rooster and cock are terms for 
        adult male birds, and a younger male may be called a cockerel.
         A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen,
          and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.</p>

          <p>Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food     (consuming both their meat and eggs) or as pets. 
           Traditionally they were also bred for cockfighting, 
           which is still practiced in some places. 
           Chickens domesticated for meat are broilers and for eggs are layers.
